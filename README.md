*A project of the Digital Services Working Group at the [Metropolitan Area Planning Council](https://www.mapc.org)*

## Background

From the State of Massachusetts Efficiency and Regionalization Grant Program proposal:

> The Metropolitan Area Planning Council proposes to provide digital technical assistance to build, either in-house or through collective procurement, an online permitting platform for managing and processing street opening permits. Additionally, the team would provide consulting expertise in order to integrate this platform with existing GIS and data management processes (paper or electronic), and to develop a sustainable revenue stream for ongoing hosting costs of the new permitting platform. ... Deliverables for this work will include:
> - A common, shared data format for street opening and trench permits across the participating municipalities;
> - A reduction in administrative cost and burden to municipal staff, eliminating time consuming, paper-based or partially-electronic permitting processes;
> - Shared cost of a system that will upgrade permitting processes municipalities to a sustainable, open source, cloud-hosted system; and
> - Improved open records compliance by providing a way to quickly publish permitting records electronically
