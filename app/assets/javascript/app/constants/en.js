    DESCRIPTION: 'By creating editable links for utilities and other town ' +
        'departments, they can contribute to the plans published on your ' +
        'town\'s Roadworks map. Instead of usernames and passwords, these ' +
        'links serve to "log in" other contributors. Only share these links ' +
        'with their respective owners. You can revoke access at any time by ' +
        'generating a new link for a particular contributor (which will ' +
        'invalidate the old link).',
    REGENERATE_WARNING: 'Be careful! Generating a new editable link will ' +
        'invalidate the old link for this contributor. This contributor will ' +
        'no longer be able to edit their plans on Roadworks using the old ' +
        'link.',
